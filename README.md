This repository contains my work for MATH 3MB3: Introduction to Modelling, a course I am taking during the Winter 2025 term at McMaster University. It includes all my labs, assignments, and any additional projects completed throughout the term. The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey and share how Iâ€™ve applied mathematical modeling techniques to solve real-world problems.
